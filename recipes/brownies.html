    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These cake-like brownies are the most delicious, fudgy treats that I have ever eaten. They are so moist and super quick and easy to make. For best results, use Dutch-processed cocoa. For less cake-like brownies, use all-purpose flour instead of self-rising.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>baking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup walnut halves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan with baking spray.</li>
        <li>Whisk sugar, flour, melted butter, eggs, cocoa powder, vanilla, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Decorate with walnut halves.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is crinkled and a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack before slicing into squares. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
